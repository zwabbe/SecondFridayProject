# Description 


Welcome to my second Friday Project! This is a test to take in a little bit of info about the user(You!) and tell them which programming language they should learn first!



# My links:


Check out my main [Repo](https://github.com/zwabbe/) here!

 



# Use/Installation 



You can check out the live page over [here!](https://zwabbe.github.io/SecondFridayProject/)


How to use the site:

* Steps are pretty easy but follow along if you need:

  * Input your name into the text field! 

  * Select your favorites between the options (Make sure to select them all...or else...)
 
  * Press submit to get your answer!




## If you wish to make your own changes to the site follow this :



* Clone the repo with this link:https://github.com/zwabbe/SecondFridayProject.git

* Open Index.html with your preferred editor and plug away with any edits you'd like! I suggest using VScode! 

* To view it just open the index.html file and it should open with your default browser.

# Known bugs / Issues

* None at first glance but please message me if you find something that I didn't!
